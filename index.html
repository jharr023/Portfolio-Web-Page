            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            After graduating High School, I went to college for a couple years, but couldn't land on a subject that interested me enough to justify the cost.<br>
            I took a break from school for a year, working full time at a local game store instead. When I started looking back into furthering my education, 
            Thinkful caught my eye, and now I'm working towards becoming a software engineer through the full-stack program! I enjoy playing video games and painting.
